## Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard that provides insights into employee attendance patterns using data analytics and visualization techniques. The dataset comprises attendance records, including presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL) statuses, tracked over a specific period. This dashboard serves as a tool for HR departments and management to monitor attendance trends, identify potential issues, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee engagement and productivity.
The dashboard was built using Power BI, offering real-time interactive features that allow users to explore various aspects of employee attendance. Key metrics such as overall presence percentage, WFH percentage, and sick leave percentage were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of attendance patterns. The visualizations include line charts for trend analysis over time, tables for detailed daily breakdowns, and filters to drill down by specific time periods or employees.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard:
1.	Overall Attendance Metrics:
o	The dashboard reveals a high overall presence rate of 91.83%, indicating that employees are generally maintaining good attendance. The percentage of employees working from home stands at 10.00%, while sick leave is relatively low at 1.10%. These metrics suggest a stable attendance pattern with minimal disruption due to sickness.
2.	Presence, WFH, and SL Trends Over Time:
o	The line charts tracking daily presence, WFH, and sick leave percentages show variations across different months. Notably, presence dipped to its lowest at 77.92% in May 2022, indicating possible seasonal trends or events affecting attendance. Meanwhile, WFH peaked at 23.44% around the same period, suggesting a possible shift to remote work or a response to specific circumstances.
3.	Attendance Patterns by Day of the Week:
o	Analysis of attendance data by day of the week reveals that presence rates are highest on Mondays (93.21%) and Tuesdays (93.03%), with a gradual decline towards the weekend, hitting the lowest on Fridays (90.19%). This pattern indicates a tendency for reduced office presence as the week progresses.
o	WFH percentages show a significant increase on Fridays (13.01%), which could suggest a policy or preference for remote work towards the end of the workweek.
4.	Sick Leave Analysis:
o	The sick leave percentage is relatively low across all days, with Mondays showing the highest rate at 1.62%. This insight might suggest employees are more likely to take sick leave at the start of the week, possibly after weekends.
o	Peaks in the sick leave percentage on specific dates could be investigated further to understand any underlying causes, such as flu seasons or specific events leading to increased sickness.
5.	Employee-Specific Insights:
o	Detailed tables provide individual employee attendance metrics, allowing for targeted analysis. For example, some employees, like Thanos Thakur, have maintained 100% presence, while others, such as Trystan Ortega, have a lower presence rate (72.22%) and higher instances of sick leave.
o	This granular level of detail helps HR teams identify patterns at the individual level and offer personalized support or interventions if needed.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
The attendance dashboard offers valuable insights into employee attendance patterns, highlighting areas of stability and concern. With a high overall presence rate, the organization demonstrates good employee engagement. However, fluctuations in presence and WFH trends suggest opportunities to optimize attendance policies and remote work arrangements. By continuously monitoring these trends, the organization can proactively address attendance-related issues, maintain productivity, and enhance employee satisfaction.
Regular updates to the dashboard and incorporating feedback from stakeholders will ensure it remains a relevant and effective tool for managing workforce attendance. Further analysis could include correlating attendance data with productivity metrics to understand the impact of different attendance patterns on overall business performance.
